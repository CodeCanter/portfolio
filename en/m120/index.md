![Wycelowanie_M120](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0942f580-8131-49ec-8e66-bf1a83944e9b)

Developed during service in the 15th Giżycko Mechanized Brigade. A real-time simulation designed to enhance the realism and engagement of mortar platoon training while conserving combat equipment and ammunition.

Project assumptions:
- enabling training of Fire Observer teams in the field of detecting, recognizing and determining the location of targets and conducting firing
- enabling improvement of operators in the field of mortar aiming, calculating and entering settings, keeping a gunner's commander's note and conducting semi-indirect fire
- enabling conducting training in directing the fire of a mortar platoon - simultaneous training of the Fire Observer and the Mortar Crews
- application of a simplified method of modeling the projectile's flight path - the model corresponds to the firing tables (FIRING TABLES for 120 mm MORTAR mod. 1938 and mod. 1943) for all charges, at all ranges, for all intended firing conditions

Technologies: Unity 3D, CAD, Dark Rift Networking
