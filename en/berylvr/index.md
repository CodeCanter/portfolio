**VR Demonstrator for Infantry Training** (06.2019 - 09.2022)
![1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cb28cf0a-b663-49de-9c4e-3f03c269c62c)

A project aimed at expanding the laboratory base of the Tactical Simulation Branche.

Project assumptions:
- checking the impact of using VR goggles, VR treadmill and a rifle model (equipped with a microcontroller and sensors) on the realism of infantryman training in a virtual simulation environment
- enabling training of manual operations on the weapon, e.g. matching sights and pulling the trigger
- enabling the instructor to better supervise the activities performed by the trainee
- using a simplified method of modelling the projectile's flight path (coefficients selected experimentally) - the model corresponds to shooting tables at the effective fire range
- mapping the behaviour of weapon manipulators (5.56 mm kbs wz. 96 "Beryl") - trigger, fire type switch, safety catch and sight setting

Technologies: Unity 3D, CAD, microcontroller platform, 3D printing
